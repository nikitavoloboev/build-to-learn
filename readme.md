# Learning [![Thanks](http://bit.ly/saythankss)](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev)

> Building things for deeper understanding/practice.

The repo is organized into sections by context (language/technology). Each section has little projects with code. Bigger projects are extracted into [their own GitHub repos](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-github). The purpose of this repo is a playground for ideas & new learnings.

I also use this repo to test out code in different languages. I ignore these test files as they may contain sensitive info. The actual repo for me looks like:

```bash
~/src/learning
❯ tree -L 2
├── bash
│   └── run.sh
├── c
│   └── run.c
├── elixir
│   └── run.es
```

I have Alfred workflow that searches through the root folders in this repo. On return, the folder gets opened in VS Code.

I can open a lot of these test files directly with [KM macro](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros):

I use [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) to automatically run code on file changes. Makes prototyping ideas and libraries a breeze.
